# Styleguide

### Goals

Replicate the functionality and general way-of-being of [**patternlab.io](http://patternlab.io),** or [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). in a Hugo/TND context. 

- Build as Hugo module so that we can utilize within a project.
- Tightly couple the Styleguide to our Hugo site's tailwind config stylesheet.
- Designer makes entries and edits via Netlify CMS.

See examples for functionality ideas, but a few key items:

- A visual representation of a site's design elements with copyable code and an area for description.
- 

### Current issues

- Need patternlab's viewport functionality
- Make sure we organize content in a way that allows us to expand in a logical way.

### Examples

This is probably the best model:  [https://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/?p=components-overview](https://boltdesignsystem.com/pattern-lab/?p=components-overview)
